        <section id="#about"><h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am currently a student at SAIT studying interactive graphic design. One of my hobby I enjoy greatly is video gaming on the PC, and I have always taken note to art and design that are displayed on these games. To explore my curiosity I chose to expand my knowledge in artwork and design by continuing my education in interactive graphic design.</p>

        <section id="hobbies"><h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>A hobby I mentioned previously was video gaming, it’s a large portion of my life, I’ve been playing all types of PC video games since a little kid. Another hobby of mine would be to read fiction novels, I love immersing myself in worlds I imagine as I read and wishing it could be real. I am also a moviegoer goer, because like reading, I can also escape reality during the duration of a movie and immerse myself in that world as well.</p>

            <p>Here is my collection of designs I have done for interactive graphic design. They are based off gun skins of a game I enjoy playing, Valorant.</p>
